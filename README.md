# Data-Science-Rice-Leaf-Disease-detection

##  Rice leaf disease detection by using Deep learning model Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).
## Introduction
The rice leaf suffers from several bacterial, viral, or fungal diseases and these diseases reduce rice production. Using a Dataset of Rice Leaf Disease images, a number of CNN-based models are trained to identify three common rice leaf diseases.

#### Convolutional Neural Network(CNN):
 A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.
